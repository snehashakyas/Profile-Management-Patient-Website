# Patient Profile Management Application

This project is a simple Patient Profile Mangement application. A user is able to create their own user account, and then add, edit, delete and view medical patients with their account only. Users can also mark patients as "special attention patients", which will appear at the top of the website in alphabetical order. Different users cannot access other users' patient data as proper access control is enforced.

This application has two parts:
1. Client side, where patient data is visualized and interacted with.
2. Server side, where patient data is processed. The server is exposed via RESTful APIs.
